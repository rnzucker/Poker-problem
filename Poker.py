'''This Python program solves Project Euler problem #54.
It reads in a file with two poker hands per line and determines
how many are won by hand one. There are no ties.

Much of the code is not as efficient as could be. It was written
with understanding and maintainability in mind. Parts of the code
are described in the adjacent file outline.vim
